I am an early career software developer seeking a new challenge on my path towards the software developer. I recently graduated from Makers Academy where I developed programming skills in JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. I am passionate about learning new tools and technologies - currently learning React and Bootstrap.

## Projects


## Skills

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.

#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2019 - October 2019)

During the 16 weeks of intensive bootcamp I gained experience in Test-Driven Development using:
* Ruby, RSpec, Rails, Capybara, Sinatra
* JavaScript, jQuery, React, Jasmin, Jest
* PostgreSQL
* Linting, code quality, test coverage with rubocop,simplecov
* Continuous Integration with Travis
* Continous deployment with Heroku
* Version control through Git and GitHub
* Agile (~2 week) group projects: Trello for Kanban, MVP, pairing in 2-day sprints, stand-ups and retros

I acquired the ability and appreciation for pair programming. I am familiar with modeling along the MVC lines, and creating applications following the principles of object-oriented programming.

I worked in three self-organising teams leaning on the agile methodology principles.

All my efforts a Makers were guided by the Extreme Programming Values.

#### Glyndwr University

*Postgraduate Study & Research Methods . 
*Networking Hardware and Software . 
*Networking Techniques & Technologies . 
*Database Systems and Analytics . 
*Software Development - Object-Oriented Programming .

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person
