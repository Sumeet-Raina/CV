I am an early career software developer seeking a new challenge on my path towards full-stack software engineering. I recently graduated from Makers Academy where I developed programming skills in JavaScript, Ruby, and Python. I am passionate about learning new tools and technologies - currently learning React and Bootstrap.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2019 - October 2019)

During the 16 weeks of intensive bootcamp I gained experience in Test-Driven Development using:
* Ruby, JavaScript, Rails
* HTML & CSS
* RSpec, Jasmine, Capybara
* PostgreSQL
* Linting, code quality, test coverage with rubocop, simplecov
* Continuous Integration with Travis
* Continous deployment with Heroku
* Version control through Git and GitHub
* Agile (~2 week) group projects: Trello for Kanban, MVP, pairing in 2-day sprints, stand-ups and retros

I acquired the ability and appreciation for pair programming. I am familiar with modeling along the MVC lines, and creating applications following the principles of object-oriented programming.

I worked in three self-organising teams leaning on the agile methodology principles.

All my efforts a Makers were guided by the Extreme Programming Values.

#### Glyndwr University (January 2014 - March 2015)

of technology on autistic children

#### Postgraduate diploma in computer applications (September 2008 - April 2009)

* Fundamentals of Computer & Operating Systems

& Uses of Internet

## Skills

**Communication**   
Throughout my career I have always worked in environments built on the ability to make yourself understood. Whether explaining a lesson to children in the classroom, conflict resolution on the playground, debating on how to implement the curriculum with my colleagues or helping staff work through their technical difficulties.
Whilst at Makers Academy I feel I have grown my abilities during pair programming sessions and working on group projects, I have become more confident speaking out in meetings and making sure I can add my experience to situations that demand it.

**Passion for Learning**  
During my time working in education, my focus was always on how I could best teach others and in turn this taught me a lot about how I learn myself.
Taught myself how to code initially.
Enjoy reading about cognitive psychology to find out how I can learn more effectively.  

**Problem Solving**  
My love of problem solving has grown exponentially since I started programming., I now revel in working my way out of a difficult debugging problem, or researching how to best go about utilising a new technology.
